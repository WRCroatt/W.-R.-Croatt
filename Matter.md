- Matter
  - **Matter:** anything that occupies space and has mass
  - **Force:** an act of matter to change position or motion
  - **Inertia:** a property causing matter to resist a change in motion or position 
  - Mass vs Weight
    - **Mass:** the amount of matter that an object contains—mass responsible for weight
    - **Weight:** the measure of the earth's attraction for matter
- The States of Matter
  - **Solid:** form of matter that has defined shape and volume
  - **Liquid:** form of matter that flows, has defined volume, and takes the shape of what contains it
  - **Gas:** form of matter that takes the shape and volume of what contains it
  - Other Terms
    - **Vapor:** describes a substance that, although in a gaseous state, is generally a solid or liquid at room temperature
    - **Fluid:** anything that flows, either liquid or gaseous, and require vessels to contain them
  - **Plasma:** the fourth state of matter
    - Gasses heated to high enough temperatures to separate atoms and strip off electrons (ionized gasses) 
    - Low temperature/partial (cold) plasmas can be created in fluorescent lights, neon signs
        50,000°K - 100,000°K
    - Highly ionized/hot plasmas can be created in stars, lightning bolts, and welding torches 
        10,000,000°K - 100,000,000°K
- Properties of Matter
  - **Physical Properties:** those that can be determined without changing the substance's composition
    - Color, solubility, mass, odor, hardness, density, electrical charge, magnetism, melting point, boiling point, etc. 
  - **Physical Changes**
    - Cutting, grinding, bending
    - Phase changes
    - **Sublimation:** a phase change that bypasses the liquid phase 
      - Iodine: solid to gas
      - Frost: gas to solid (deposition) 
  - **Chemical Properties:** those that describe the behavior of a substance in processes that alter its composition
    - Rusting, decomposition, fermentation, burning, etc. 
    - **Chemical Change:** when a substance undergoes a change in its chemical properties
  - Every substance has a unique set of physical and chemical properties 
- Mixtures
  - **Mixture:** consist of a physical blend of two or more substances
    - **Heterogeneous Mixture:** not uniform in composition 
    - **Homogeneous Mixture:** completely uniform in composition
  - **Solution:** homogenous mixture
  - **Pure Sunstance:** in contrast to a mixture, consists of only one compound or element
- Elements vs Compounds
  - **Element:** the simplest form of matter that can exist under normal laboratory conditions
  - **Compound:** a substance that can be separated into a simpler substance by chemical reaction
