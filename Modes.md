#### Mode/Triad Relationships
| (Major Chord) | Major Modes | Minor Modes | (Minor Chord) |

#### Mode/Circle of Fifths Relationships 
| Direction on Circle | Mode | Parent Major Scale |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Clockwise | C Lydian | G |
|  | C Ionian | C |
|  | C Mixolydian | F |
|  | C Dorian | B-flat |
|  | C Aeolian | E-flat |
|  | C Phrygian | A-flat |
| Counterclockwise | C Locrian | D-flat |  
*Notice that these major scales all follow the order of the circle of fifths, the Ionian scale fitting with C at the top of the clock, and working it's way around the circle. Apply this to any key, for example, if you were looking for the parent major scale of E-flat Dorian, put the Ionian mode on E-flat on the circle of fifths, and move from there two keys counterclockwise, and you will land on E-flat Dorian, which is D-flat. *
