# Intervals, Inversions and Consonance 
- **Inverted Interval:** when the top note is lowered an octave or the bottom note is raised an octave. These changes follow specific patterns:  

#### Inversions

| Perfect | Major/Minor | M/m | +/° |
|-----:|:-----|-----:|:-----|
| P1 — P8 | M2 — m7 | M — m | + — ° |
| P8 — P1 | m2 — M7 | m — M | ° — +|
| P5 — P4 | M3 — m6 |  |  |
| P4 — P5 | m3 — M6 |  |  |

- **Rule of Nines:** all Inversions will add to nine:

| Rule of Nines |
|:--------:|
| 1+8=9 |
| 2+7=9 |
| 3+6=9 |
| 4+5=9 |

- The inversion in which the bottom note is the root of the chord is saud to be in **root position.** If the root is moved up an octave so that the bottom note is the second in the chord, it is in **first inversion.** If the third is on the bottom, it is in **second inversion.** The pattern continues.  
- A chord in root position is simply written without a symbol. So C in root position is simply written as C. If it is moved to first inversion, it is written differently. From the E at the bottom to the top note, a C, there is a sixth, thus a 6 is written in subscript. In second inversion, there is a sixth from the G on the bottom to the E on top, and a fourth from the G on the bottom to the C in the middle, so in subscript you write a 6 above a 4. Adjust this rule according to the chord.  

|  | Root Position | 1st Inversion | 2nd Inversion | 3rd Inversion |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| C | C | C(6) | C(6/4) |  |
| D7 | D7 | D7(6) | D7(6/3) | D7 (6/2/3) |

- **Consonant Intervals:** intervals that sound pleasing to the ear
- **Dissonant Intervals:** intervals that sound harsh to the ear

| Consonant | Neutral | Dissonant |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| M3 | P1 | M2 |
| m3 | P4 | m2 |
| M6 | P5 | Tritone |
| m6 | P8 | M7 |
|  |  | m7 |
*Notice that the different types of Intervals above follow the Rule of Nines. The 6's and the 3's, for example, are both paired under the consonant column. *
