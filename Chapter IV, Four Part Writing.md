##### Basic Vocal Ranges
- Soprano: C4 (middle C)—G5  
- Alto: G3—E5  
- Tenor: C3—G4  
- Bass: F2—C4 (middle C)  

##### Doubling and Spacing
- Doubling a note in a chord is necessary considering that there are only three notes in any given triad. The most satisfying note to double is the root if the chord, though the 5th is another option. The 3rd should be avoided.
- Soprano and Tenor stems go up, Alto and Bass stems go down.  
- Between the top three parts, there should be no more than an octave separating the upper three parts. The Bass part may play as low as needed. 

##### Active and Inactive Tones
- **Active Tone:** demands movement in a particular direction. Unstable and create pressure that can only be resolved by moving to an inactive tone. Active tones are 2, 4, 6, and 7.
- **Inactive Tone:** Have no strong tendency to move, but instead have a feeling if repose and are "at rest". Inactive tones are 1, 3, 5, and 8.
- 1<—2, 3<—4, 5<—6—>7—>8

##### Voice Movement and Melodic Skips
- Each part should know move smoothly from one chord to another with as little movement as possible. Exceptions may be for Melodic variety and contrast, and for the restricted bass line. Excessive leaps should be avoided, except for when a chord is repeated. In that case, the Soprano and possibly all three upper voices may skip to another chord tone.
- No two voices should ever move in parallel perfect intervals.

##### Types of Motion
- Similar: tones of an interval move in the sane direction, but not the same distance
- Parallel: tones of an interval move in the sake direction, the sane distance 
- Contrary: the upper and lower tones move in opposite directions
- Oblique: one tone is repeated, the other moves
*One should avoid writing parallel perfect intervals. *

##### Types of Crossing to Avoid
-  Crossing: an upper voice should never be lower than a lower voice.
- Overlapping: when owing from one chord to another, no upper voice should in the second chord be lower than a lower voice in the first, and vice versa.

##### Chord Movement
- A common and very pleasing sound occurs when the upper three voices move in opposition to the bass. It also helps to keep from breaking various rules. 

##### Complete and Incomplete Chords
- Use complete chords as much as possible (the full triad, with proper doubling). Occasionally, when it is impossible, triple the root and add a third, as this ensures the child will have quality and flavor.
