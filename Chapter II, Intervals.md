# Chapter II,  Intervals
- **Interval:** a combination of two tones, and the distance between those two tones
- **Melodic Interval:** two tones sounded in succession
- **Harmonic Interval:** two tones sounded at the same time
*The quality and character of an interval is determined by the distance between the two tones, and by their relationship to the tonic. *

Any interval is identified by the number of steps between the lower note and the upper note. For example, from C to G is a fifth. Also, any interval that is not classified as a perfect interval is either major (M) or minor (m). A half step above the major or perfect interval is augmented (+), and a half step below the minor or perfect is diminished (°). 
#### Interval Notation and Structure

| Structure | Perfect | Major/Minor | Structure |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Expanded | Augmented (+) | Augmented (+) | Expanded |
| Interval | Perfect (P) | Major (M) | Interval |
| Contracted | Diminished (°) | Minor (m) | Interval |
|  |  | Diminished (°) | Contracted |

- **Consonant Interval:** an interval that is pleasing to hear, satisfying, or "at rest" 
  - **Perfect Consonants:** unison, 5th, octave
  - **Imperfect Consonants:** major or minor 3rd or 6th
- **Dissonant Interval:** an unpleasant interval that usually requires movement or resolution to satisfy the ear
  - **Perfect Dissonant:** 4th 
  - **Imperfect Dissonants:** major or minor 2nd or 7th  
*While the perfect fourth is not unpleasant to the ear, it is considered dissonant because it usually requires resolution to a M3

- **Inverted Interval:** the lower note has been raised an octave, or the upper note has been lowered an octave; the interval has been turned upside down  
#### Inversion Rules
| Intervals | Degrees |
|-----|-----|
| per. < > per. | 1 < > 8 |
| Major. < > min. | 2 < > 7 |
| aug. < > dim. | 3 < > 6 |
|  | 4 < > 5 |

- **Compound Interval:** an interval in which two tones are more than an octave apart
- The notation for a compound interval is finding the interval in the case that there wasn't an extra octave between them, i.e. C is typically M3 from E. Then add a C to the interval to indicate that there are one or more octaves between them, i.e. CM3. 

- **Enharmonic Interval:** two intervals with the same tones
  - Ex. °5 and +4; °7 and M6; +6 and m7
