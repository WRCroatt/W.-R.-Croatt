# Chapter III, Triads
- **Form and Function:** a study of the structure or the means of which an item is put together and the way in which it is used  
- **Chord:** combination of three or more tones sounded together  
  - Two notes sounded together are not a chord, but may imply a chord. For example, a M6 played harmonically often implies a major chord in the second inversion.  
- **Arpeggio:** notes of a chord played melodically, in succession  

- **Triad:** three note chord made up of a root, a third, and a fifth  
  - One may also see a triad as a third stacked on top of another third.  

- **Inversion:** when a chord is not written with the root at the bottom of the chord

#### Inversions of a C Chord
| Root Position | First Inversion | Second Inversion |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| C E G | E G C | G C E |

- **Closed Position:** a chord in any inversion that is condensed as much as possible  
- **Open Position:** a chord that is spread out across the staff so that some notes within the chord's range could be added but are not  
- **Nomenclature:**  
  - I Tonic—or keynote  
  - VII Leading Tone—an urgent tendency to the tonic  
  - VI Submediant—midway between tonic and subdominant  
  - V Dominant—the dominating factor in a key  
  - IV Subdominant—immediately below dominant  
  - III Mediant—midway between tonic and dominant  
  - II Supertonic—one step above tonic
  - I Tonic—or keynote  

#### Major Triads
| Diminished | Minor | Major | Augmented |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| I III° V° | I III° V | I III V | I III V+ |

#### Triads Built from C
|  | I | ii | iii | IV | V | vi | vii° |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Chord | Maj | min | min | Maj | Maj | min | dim |
| 3rd | M | m | m | M | M | m | m |
| 5th | P | P | P | P | P | P | ° |

#### G Major
|  | Tonic | Supertonic | Mediant | Subdominant | Dominant | Submediant | Leading Tone |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Nomenclature | I | ii | iii | IV | V | vi | vii° |
| Chord | Maj | min | min | Maj | Maj | min | dim |

#### G Harmonic Minor
|  | Tonic | Supertonic | Mediant | Subdominant | Dominant | Submediant | Leading Tone |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Nomenclature | i | ii° | III+ | iv | V | VI | vii° |
| Chord | min | dim | Aug | min | Maj | Maj | dim |
*The augmented chord is not very useful, and thus is often found as a Major chord without the raised seventh.*

#### Altering Triads
- Maj—min: lower the 3rd  
- Maj—dim: lower the 3rd, lower the 5th  
- Maj—Aug: raise the 5th  
- min—Maj: raise the 3rd  
- min—dim: lower the 5th  
- min—Aug: raise the 3rd, raise the 5th  
- dim—Maj: raise the 3rd, raise the 5th  
- dim—min: raise the 5th  
- dim—Aug: raise the 3rd, raise the 5th ×2  
- Aug—Maj: lower the 5th  
- Aug—min: lower the 3rd, lower the 5th  
- Aug—dim: lower the 3rd, lower the 5th ×2  

#### Chord Labels
- Major: large Roman numerals—I, IV, V  
- Minor: small Roman numerals—ii, iii, vi  
- Diminished: small Roman numerals, degree symbol—vii°  
- Augmented: large Roman numerals with a plus sign—III+

#### Primary and Secondary Triads
- **Primary Triads:** triads on I, IV, and V, called this because of their importance in a key  
- **Secondary Triads:** triads on ii, iii, vi, and vii
