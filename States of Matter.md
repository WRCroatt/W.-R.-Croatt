- **Molecule:** two or more bonds of separate atoms
- **Atom:** an element made up of a nucleus, which is a spherical group of protons and neutrons, and electrons orbiting around the nucleus

- **Solid:** a substance whose molecular structure is uniform, close together, and whose individual molecules are vibrating in place
- **Liquid:** a substance whose molecular structure is less together, more spaced out, and whose molecules move freely
- **Gas:** a substance whose molecular structure is not uniform, whose molecules are rapidly moving

##### Phase Change
- Solid—Liquid: Melting
- Liquid—Solid: Feeezing
- Liquid—Gas: Vaporization
- Gas—Liquid: Condensation
- Solid—Gas: Sublimation  
- Gas—Solid: Deposition

- Melting Point/Freezing Point: 0°C
- Vaporization Point/Condensation Point: 100°C

- Between two different states of matter, such as between Solid and Liquid, thermal energy can build up before the temperature changes. Within a state of matter, thermal energy and temperature rise with each other. This creates a graph that looks a bit like a staircase.
